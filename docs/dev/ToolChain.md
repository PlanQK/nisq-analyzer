This presents the tool chain used for creating and updating a pull request on GitHub.

For the general setup, please go to [ToolChain-initialization](ToolChain-initialization.md).

## Steps for working on a topic

  1. Create a new branch for each topic (fix a bug, add functionality) and name it accordingly.
     - Thesis: `thesis/SHORT-THESIS-TITLE`. Replace `SHORT-THESIS-TITLE` with something meaningful
     - EnPro: prefix `fix`, `feature`, `wip` (see below) with `enpro/`
     - StuPro: prefix `fix`, `feature`, `wip` (see below) with `stupro/`
     - Bugfix: `fix/issue-NNN` or `fix/SHORT-TITLE` if fixing an issue with a number or give it a title
     - Feature: `feature/issue-NNN` or `feature/SHORT-TITLE`
     - WIP: `wip/SHORT-TITLE` for work in progress without issue and you know won't be finished soon
  2. Sync with latest changes on origin (especially master branch): `git fetch origin`.
  3. Create branch based on `upstream/master` and make it known publicly:
     - `git checkout upstream/master`
     - `git checkout -b [name]`
     - `git push --set-upstream origin [name]`
  4. Do you your fist commit. Don't forget to sign the commit (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> in Git Gui).
  6. Push the changes to origin: `git push`.
  7. Create [WIP] Pull Request.
     - Go to <https://github.com/PlanQK/QC-Atlas> ðŸ¡’ Pull Request
     - Change the "base branch" to PlanQK/QC-Atlas
     - Fill in the title of the Pull Request following the pattern `[WIP] Title of the thesis/work/target`
     - Fill in the provided description form
     - Add `[x]` to the items listed in the write field
     - Check the description in the Preview and send the Pull Request
  8. There are automatic checks in place
  9. If there is a red cross, click in respective "Details" and fix them

**You keep working and discuss with your supervisor how things go.**

After each working day, do the following:
    
  1. Commit. Don't forget to sign the commit (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> in Git Gui).
  2. `git push`
  3. Keep your branch updated with `upstream/master`:
     - `git fetch upstream`
     - `git merge upstream/master`
     - Resolve conflicts - if there are some. See <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/resolving-conflicts.html> for a documentation when using IntellIJ.
     - `git push`


## GitHub - Prepare Final Pull Request

The aim of these steps to have a **single commit**.

**Before commencing these steps, check with your supervisor**

### Git Steps: Ensure that a single commit is created

  1. `git fetch upstream` - fetches all updates from https://github.com/PlanQK/QC-Atlas ("upstream") to the local git storage
  2. `git merge upstream/master` - merges all updates from upstream to the local branch
  3. (Resolve merge conflicts) - required if there are conflicting changes
  4. Commit & Push with signed commit message (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> in Git Gui) - this ensures that you have the changes backuped in case something goes wrong at the next steps 
  5. `git reset upstream/master` - this prepares that all commits can be squashed together:
     The local checkout ("working tree") is left untouched, but the "pointer" of the current branch is reset to `upstream/master`.
     Now, Git Gui shows the difference between `upstream/master` and your changes.
  6. Check changes in Git Gui:
     - Each change you wanted: Is it recognized?
     - At each file: Is the copyright information in the [header](https://github.com/PlanQK/QC-Atlas/blob/7d0bc47488eb2db19052725706081c6bcb07119d/docs/dev/config/IntelliJ%20IDEA/CodeHeaders.md) OK?
     - Check if you are listed in the [NOTICE](https://github.com/PlanQK/QC-Atlas/blob/master/NOTICE) file as a contributor with the correct year
     - Are there too much changed lines? ðŸ¡’ Do not stage spurious lines to the commit (e.g., tab to spaces, ...)
     - Are there too much changed files? ðŸ¡’ Do not stage files you did not intend to change (e.g., `pom.xml` if you did not touch `pom.xml` at all)
     - Check again the style (!)
     - (Don't forget RESCAN to see the current changes)
  7. Add Changes/Fixed to `CHANGELOG.md` and add description to `docs/index.md` (if helpful)
  8. Press "Stage to Commit" ðŸ¡’ all changes are staged to Commit
  9. Sign the Commit Message (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> in Git Gui)
  10. Commit & Push with "force overwrite" since you changed the branch: `git push -f`

## GitHub - Create Final Pull Request

**Attention: Commits on the same branch done after the Pull Request is sent are still part of the Pull Request (!)**

* Go to https://github.com/PlanQK/QC-Atlas ðŸ¡’ Pull Request
* Fill in the title of the Pull Request and give a more detailed description of the changes or added functionality
* In case of UI changes: Add screenshots
* Add `[x]` to the items listed in the write field
* Check the description in the Preview and send the Pull Request
* Close your Pull Request at PlanQK/QC-Atlas with a comment referencing the full URL of the new Pull Request, e.g. `Follow up at https://github.com/PlanQK/QC-Atlas/pull/212`.


## GitHub - Change Final Pull Request

* There are automatic checks in place

* If there is a red cross, click in repective "Details" and fix them

* In case of missing code quality, ... changes are requested by a committer (person controlling the pull request process)
* FOR QC-ATLAS THE FOLLOWING APPLIES:
  - Open Git Gui
  - Make requested changes in your code (don't forget to RESCAN)
  - Commit
  - Push
  - Wait for a second review
  - In case everything is fine, squash the commits into one.
    See [GitHub - Prepare Pull Request](#github---prepare-pull-request).
    Then, do a force push (`git push -f`).


## GitHub - After Pull Request Got Merged

* Delete the branch locally.
* The branch on origin (<https://github.com/PlanQK/QC-Atlas>) is deleted by the maintainer having done the merge.
